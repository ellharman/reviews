**I distinctly** remember, as a young interactive media connoisseur (annoying teenager), taking the piss out of my friend for the heinous crime of 'being into point and click games' - the likes of Grim Fandango and Sam & Max. Little did I know that at the ripe old age of 27 I would be spending the most part of a weekend playing, to be excessively reductive, click-and-drag Cluedo in the form of *The Case of the Golden Idol* from Color Gray Games, and having a blast.

Set in the late 18th century, we are told the story of a series of *unfortunate* deaths in the form of grotesquely detailed pixel art dioramas. Each of these tableaus has something to do with the pursuit of the titular golden idol, and the lengths the characters we follow throughout the story will go to to to get hold of it and the power it contains; the player is left to piece together what happened by dragging words they find in the scene into mental 'scrolls' representing our idea of what happened.

The game does an outstanding job of making you feel like a detective. With a remarkably light touch on the art and text, the developers manage to reach in and make most of the drama play out in your own mind as you figure out what happened on each stage. I'm really glad to have played this over just two sittings rather than breaking it apart any more than that, as being able to identify characters from a few levels back on sight as you learn the major players involved in the cases (and their motives) is a supremely satisfying feeling. There was one instance where I ended up on the brink of relearning how to solve simultaneous equations to figure out the clues for a stage, and I think that's where I realised that I had truly become wrapped up in the story and logic of 18th century "Britain".

Color Gray Games really stick the landing too, with everything being wrapped up nicely after the game's 12 levels, with an epilogue where you yourself summarise everything that went down. All in all, a stand-out experience that didn't overstay its welcome.

## Rating: 8.5/10

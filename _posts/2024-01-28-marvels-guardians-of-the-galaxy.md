I am really not a Marvel girlie at heart - I haven't really engaged with the extended universe at all for the last 5 years at least, and in general a game like this wouldn't have ended up on my radar. However, I heard good things about the narrative and that it was something of a sleeper hit of 2021, and I had enjoyed the first Guardians of the Galaxy film and thought it stood out from the rest of Marvel at the time (perhaps just by virtue of not being attached to the Avengers schlock-machine), so I decided to give it a try.

Despite my best efforts to keep at this and see what the fuss was about, after about 4 hours of playtime I just couldn't keep at it. The combat system in the game was just too dry and unchallenging to really produce a satisfying gameplay loop, and mostly just consisted of spamming whatever abilities came off cooldown after locking onto the nearest enemy and hoping for the best. The story itself wasn't terrible, and I am sure that it would have been relatively satisfying to see through to its conclusion, but honestly I just felt like I was watching an extremely slow movie and the payoff just wasn't worth it.

In the pros column, this is probably the best integration of meaningful story decisions into gameplay that I have seen in video games, and the voice acting is extremely well utilised - characters talk over each other in a very natural way, and the player is sporadically presented with choices relating to the passive banter of the other Guardians which leaves you feeling like an equal member of the crew rather than a bland insert. Ultimately, this game was fine but I don't think I can see myself returning to it any time soon; potentially if I was more into Marvel as a whole that would have sustained me through the lackluster combat, but I think this one maybe just isn't for me.

## Rating: 5/10

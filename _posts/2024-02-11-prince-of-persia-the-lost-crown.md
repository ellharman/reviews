This was the first Metroidvania I've ever actually completed, as far as I can remember. The genre really hasn't been a favourite of mine - I even gave wunderkind Hollow Knight a good shot, but it didn't stick for me, so to have completed this and spent a good chunk of time looking around all its nooks and crannies is high praise. Also, having read the excellent [Making of Prince of Persia: Journals 1985-1993](https://press.stripe.com/the-making-of-prince-of-persia) last year, although the original Prince of Persia games were before my time playing this felt like a nice way to close the circle with everything I remember from that.

Gameplay wise, the platforming is pretty tight and satisfying - some areas really lean on the Celeste 'surrounded by spikes and surviving by refreshing your dash' style, which personally I enjoy but which may not be for everyone. I also enjoyed that the upgrade currency was gated behind platforming puzzles - a great move that made it feel absolutely worth digging around the corners of each different area, rather than being rewarded with a lore collectible. This brings me on to the lore and the story, which to be honest wasn't the most gripping - Ubisoft seem to have landed halfway between having a directly told narrative and allowing the player to glean the story from the environment, which ultimately felt unsatisfying; I would rather have been unceremoniously thrown into Mount Qaf and left to figure out what had happened myself, although that style of storytelling may be better left to the Soulsbornes of the world.

The combat felt generally satisfying, although sometimes the enemy placement was a bit bland - ascending the final tower just before the final boss and being met with the same couple of birds on each staircase felt a bit cheap. That said, some enemy placement was inspired - I completely failed to grok the attack patterns of the soldier right outside the main hub area for my entire time with the game, and essentially expected him to smack me across the room each time I left there after 5 hours or so.

Overall, I was super happy with this entry in the Prince of Persia franchise - the game was a bit lacking in polish in places, the story was a little uninspired and the performance took a few hits occasionally, but to have kept me engaged to the end in a genre that I normally bounce right off of is an achievement.
